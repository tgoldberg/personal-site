          <p>I started angel investing in 2014 after I sold my first startup, Eventjoy, to Ticketmaster. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed spending time with other founders and riffing with them on what theyâ€™re building. Angel investing gave me a way to simultaneously help (and learn from) many founders, and get a crystal ball view into permutations of what the future might look like.</p>

          <p>I was hooked.</p>
          
          <p>Fast forward to late 2019. After doing over 20 angel investments into startups like Clearbit, Superhuman, Mercury, Tandem, Placer, and On Deck, I decided to raise a small angel fund with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulvohra" target="_blank">Rahul Vohra</a>, founder of Superhuman. We <a href="http://toddandrahulangelfund.com" target="_blank">raised $7.3M</a> from over 50+ world-class founders and operators. We use the fund to help startups find product/market fit faster, supercharge their distribution, and raise from the best investors. Itâ€™s a lot of fun.</p>
          
          <p>In 2020, we did over 50 (!) investments. Some were early-stage like Clubhouse, Levels, Daily, and WorkOS. While others were late-stage like Pitch, Coda, Descript, and Eight Sleep. In total, there are now over 100 founders in our community that are building category-defining companies.</p>
          
          <p>We have a lot of exciting things in the works for 2021. Iâ€™m now looking for a personal Chief of Staff to help scale operations, run experiments, and better support our portfolio companies.</p>
          
          
          <h1>Some things youâ€™ll work on</h1>

          <ul>
            <li>Identify and source potential investments.</li>
            <li>Conduct market research and dive deep on diligence.</li>
            <li>Assist with operations and the fund backoffice.</li>
            <li>Build and run programs for our founder and LP communities.</li>
            <li>Build internal tools and workflows using no-code apps.</li>
            <li>Support portfolio companies, especially by using your superpowers.</li>
            <li>Oversee content production and distribution.</li>
            <li>Run experiments and incubate new internal products.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h1>What Iâ€™m looking for</h1>
          
          <p>No two Chief of Staff roles are alike, but this role is designed for generalists. Youâ€™ll need to be strategic as well as tactical, with a strong bias for getting things done. Experience as an investor or founder is not required.</p>
          
          <p><b>You might be a great fit if:</b></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>You get things done. You are known for high-velocity execution.</li>
            <li>You are a fast learner. You are resourceful and teach yourself quickly.</li>
            <li>You are a strong communicator, both verbal and written.</li>
            <li>You manage your own schedule and prioritize the most impactful activities.</li>
            <li>You are a systems thinker who can be both strategic and tactical.</li>
            <li>You are inherently curious. You will see new ideas, markets, and founders every day.</li>
            <li>You can be both creative and analytical.</li>
            <li>You have built side projects for fun.</li>
            <li>You are low ego.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>These are not hard requirements, but they give an idea what Iâ€™m looking for.</p>
          
          
          <p><b>You should consider this role if</b></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>You want to learn how to invest in startups.</li>
            <li>You want to spend time helping and learning from portfolio founders.</li>
            <li>You later want to start a company or join an early-stage startup.</li>
         </ul> 
          
        
        
          <hr>
          
          <p><b>Location:</b> Remote (US timezone)</p>
          
          <p><b>Type:</b> Full-time</p>

            <li>What are your superpowers?</li>
            <li>What is a tech product you love? Why?</li>
            <li>Why does this role interest you? What would you want to get out of it?</li>
            <li>If you could invest in any early-stage startup, which would it be and why?</li>
            <li>What is something that youâ€™ve built or shipped? (e.g. startup, side project, internal tool, â€¦)</li>
